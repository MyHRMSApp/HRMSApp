## Using HelloSocialUser Adapter
This sample adapter demonstrates the [social-login-security-check](../social-login-security-check/README.md) security check.  The adapter has one REST API /hello which is protected with scope named `socialLogin`.
This adapter can be tested using the following Android app [SocialLoginApp](../SocialLoginApp/README.md).

## Implementation
The implementation consists of two components:

### HelloSocialUserResource
JAX-RS class which has one API /hello that returns the authenticated user attributes such as email, name and picture.

### HelloSocialUserResource
JAX-RS application class.

### Prerequisites
* A local installation of maven (JDK 1.7 or 1.8)

### Build and install
* Build the adapter application using maven:
    * From a **Command-line**, navigate to the **google-otp** project's root folder
    * Build the API using maven by executing `mvn clean install`
* Deploy the built adapter into your MobileFirst server by running `mvn adapter:deploy` (check that your MobileFirst
  server connection parameters are updated in the **pom.xml** file)
* You are done

### Supported Levels
